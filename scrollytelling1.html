                    <p>The Country about the Mouth of Missouri is pleasent rich and partially Settled. On the East Side of the Mississippi a leavel rich bottom extends back about 3 miles, and rises by Several elevations to the high Country, which is thinly timbered with Oake &.

                    <b>[Lewis]</b>
                    <p>The Kickapoo calls a certain water plant [14] with a large Circular floating leaf found in the ponds and marshes in the neighbourhood of Kaskaskias & Cahokia—Po-kish'-a-co-mah, of the root of this plant the Indians prepare an agreable dish, the root when taken in it's green state is from 8 to 14 inches in circumpherence    is dryed by being exposed to the sun and air or at other times with a slow fire or smoke of the chimnies, it shrinks much in drying—    The root of this plant grows in a horrizontal direction near the surface of the rich loam or mud which forms the bottoms of their ponds or morasses, generall three, sometimes four or more of these roots are attatced together by a small root or string of hearder substance of a foot or six inches in length, the root of the plant thus annually progresses shooting out a root from a bud at the extremity of the root of the presceeding years groath, this in the course of the Summer p[r]oduces a new root prepared with a bud for the progression of the next season, also one leaf and one seed stalk the stem of the former supporting or reather attatched to a large green circular leaf 18 inches to two feet in diameter which fl[o]ats while green usually on the serface of the water, the sta[l]k is propotioned to the debth of the water, and of a celindrical form, is an inch and a half in circumpherence at or near it's junction of the root thence regularly tapering to the leaf where it is perhaps not more than an inch, the large fibers of the leaf project from the extremity of the stalk in every direction at right angles from it to the circumpherence of the leaf like rays from the center, there are from twelve to eighteen of those fibers—    the leaf is nearly a circle smoth on both sides and even and regular on it's edges—    near the same part of the root from which the leaf stalk project the seed stalk dose also—    it is about the same size and form of it but usually a foot longer standing erect and bearing it[s] blossum above the surface of the water which I am informed is of a white colour—    The seed vessel or matrix is the form of a depressed cone the small extremity of which is attatced to the uper end of the stalk; before it has attained it's groath it resembles an inverted cone but when grown the base obtains a preponderancy and inclining downwards rests it's edge against the stalk—    the base is a perfect circular plain from 〈fifteen to〉 eighteen to twenty inches in circumpherence in it's succulent state, and from two to three inches in hight—    the surface of the cone when dryed by the sun and air after being exposed to the frost is purforated with two circular ranges of globular holes from twenty to 30 in number arond one which forms the center placed at the distance of from an eighth to ¼ of an inch assunder, each of those cells contains an oval nut of a light brown colour much resembling a small white oak acorn smothe extreemly heard, and containing a white cernal of an agreeable flavor; these the native frequently eat either in this state or roasted; they frequently eat them also in their succulent state—    the bear feed on the leaves of this plant in the spring and summer—    in the autumn and winter the Swan, geese, brant, ducks and other acquatic fowls feed on the root—    the one is brown, pitty and extreemly light, and when seperated from the stalks flots on the suface of the water with its base down—    the Indians procure it and prepare it for food in the following manner—    they enter the bonds [ponds] where it grows, barefooted in autumn, and feel for it among the mud which being soft and the root large and near the surface they readily find it    they easily draw it up it having no fiborus, or colateral roots to attatch it firmly to the mud    they wash and scrape a thin bleack rind off it and cut it croswise into pieces of an inch in length    when it is prepared for the pot it is of a fine white colour boils to a pulp and makes an agreeable soupe in which way it is usually dressed by the natives    when they wish to preserve it for any length of time they cut it in pieces in the manner before discribed string it on bark or leather throngs of a convenient length and hang it to dry in the sun, or exposed it to the smoke of their chimnies, when thus dryed it will keep for several years, it is esteemed as nutricius as the pumpkin or squash and is not very dissimilar in taste—    The Chipiways or sateaus call this plant Wab-bis-sa-pin or Swan-root— [15]    The ferench or Canadians know it by two names the Pois de Shicoriat or Graine de Volais—    the roots of this plant are from one foot to eighteen inches in length—</p>
                    <p>The common wild pittatoe [16] also form another article of food in savage life    this they boil untill the skin leaves the pulp easily which it will do in the course of a few minutes    the outer rind which is of a dark brown coulour is then scaped off    the pulp is of a white coulour, the pettatoe thus prepared is exposed on a scaffold to the sun or a slow fire untill it is thoroughly dryed, or at other times strung upon throngs of leather or bark and hung in the roofs of their lodges where by the influence of the fire and smoke it becomes throughly dryed, they are then prepared for use, and will keep perfectly sound many years, these they boil with meat or pound and make an agreeable bread    this pittaitoee may be used in it's green or undryed state without danger provided it be well roasted or boiled—    it produces a vine which runs too a considerable length usually intwining itself about the neighbouring bushes and weeds, the vine is somewhat branched, and in it[s] progress at the distance of 2½ inches it puts forth one leaf stem at right angles with the vine, which is furnished with two par of ovate leaves and turminated by one of a similar shape, these are of a pale green colour not indented on their edges, reather a rough appearance, the vine is small and green except near the ground where it sometime assumes a redish hue—    the fruit is connected by a small liggament at both ends extending for many yards in length and attatching together in some instances six eight or more of these pittaitoes—    it's root is pereniel    the vine annual.</p>
                    <p>There is also another root [17] found in mashey lands or ponds which is much used by the Kickapoos Chipaways and any other nations as an article of food    it is called by the Chipeways Moc-cup-pin [18]    this in it's unprepared state is not only disagreeable to the taste but even dangerous to be taken even in a small quantity; in this state it acts as a powerfull aemetic.    a small quantity will kill a hog yet prepared by the Indians it makes not only an agreeable but a nutricious food—    I have not seen the plant and can therefore only discribe it from information—    the leaf is said to be broad and to float on the water—    the root is from 10 to 12 inches in length and about ⅔ds. as much in thickness—    it has a rough black skin, the pulp is white and of a mealy substance    when properly prepared the preparation is this—    having collected a parsel of these roots you cut and split a sufficient parsel of wood which is set on end as the coliers commence the base of their coal pitts, the [l]enghts of these sticks of wood being as nearly the same as you can conveniently cut them and about 4 feet in length thus forming when put together an even surface at top    on this is thrown soft earth of from two to 3 Inches in debth the roots are laid on this and earth thrown over the whole forming the Colliers kiln complete    fire is then communicated to the wood beneath and it is suffered to burn slowly for several days untill the wood is exausted or they concieve their roots are sufficiently cooked—    they then take them out scrape them & cut them into slices crosswise of half an inch thick and laying them on a scaffold of small sticks build small fires under them and dry them untill they become perfectly firm    thus prepared they are fit for uce and will keep for years if not exposed to wet—    they are either boiled to a pulp in their soupe or less boiled eat them with bears oil or venison and bears flesh—    they sometimes pound it and make a bread of it.—</p>

Persons accustomed to the navigation of the Missouri and the Mississippi also below the mouth of this river, uniformly take the precaution to load their vessels heavyest in the bow when they ascend the stream in order to avoid the danger incedent to runing foul of the concealed timber which lyes in great quantities in the beds of these rivers</p>

                        <b>Lewis</b>
                        <p>Sunday May 20th 1804</p>
                        <p>The morning was fair, and the weather pleasant; at 10 o'clock A.M. agreeably to an appointment of the preceding day, I was joined by Capt. Stoddard, Lieuts. Milford & Worrell together with Messrs. A. Chouteau, C. Gratiot, and many other respectable inhabitants of St. Louis, who had engaged to accompany me to the Village of St. Charles. Accordingly at 12 o'clock after bidding an affectionate adieu to my Hostess, that excellent woman the spouse of Mr. Peter Chouteau, and some of my fair friends of St. Louis, we set forward to that village in order to join my friend companion and fellow laborer Capt. William Clark who had previously arrived at that place with the party destined for the discovery of the interior of the continent of North America. The first 5 miles of our route laid through a beautiful high level and fertile prairie which encircles the town of St. Louis from N.W. to S.E. The lands through which we then passed are somewhat broken up fertile; the plains and woodlands are here indiscriminately interspersed until you arrive within three miles of the village when the woodland commences and continues to the Missouri; the latter is extremely fertile. At half after one P.M. our progress was interrupted by the near approach of a violent thunderstorm from the N.W. and concluded to take shelter in a little cabin hard by until the rain should be over; accordingly we alighted and remained about an hour and a half and regaled ourselves with a cold collation which we had taken the precaution to bring with us from St. Louis.</p>
                        <p>The clouds continued to follow each other in rapid succession, insomuch that there was but little prospect of it's ceasing to rain this evening; as I had determined to reach St. Charles this evening and knowing that there was now no time to be lost I set forward in the rain, most of the gentlemen continued with me, we arrived at half after six and joined Capt Clark, found the party in good health and spirits. Supped this evening with Charles Tayong a Spanish Ensign & late Commandant of St. Charles at an early hour I retired to rest on board the barge— St. Charles is situated on the North bank of the Missouri 21 Miles above its junction with the Mississippi, and about the same distance N.W. from St. Louis; it is bisected by one principal street about a mile in length running nearly parallel with the river, the plain on which it stands—is narrow though sufficiently elevated to secure it against the annual inundations of the river, which usually happen in the month of June, and in the rear it is terminated by a range of small hills, hence the appellation of petit Cote, a name by which this village is better known to the French inhabitants of the Illinois than that of St. Charles. The Village contains a Chapel, one hundred dwelling houses, and about 450 inhabitants; their houses are generally small and but illy constructed; a great majority of the inhabitants are miserably poor, illiterate and when at home excessively lazy, though they are polite hospitable and by no means deficient in point of natural genius, they live in a perfect state of harmony among each other; and place as implicit confidence in the doctrines of their spiritual pastor, the Roman Catholic priest, as they yield passive obedience to the will of their temporal master the commandant. A small garden of vegetables is the usual extent of their cultivation, and this is commonly imposed on the old men and boys; the men in the vigor of life consider the cultivation of the earth a degrading occupation, and in order to gain the necessary subsistence for themselves and families, either undertake hunting voyages on their own account, or engage themselves as hirelings to such persons as possess sufficient capital to extend their traffic to the natives of the interior parts of the country; on those voyages in either case, they are frequently absent from their families or homes the term of six twelve or eighteen months and always subjected to severe and incessant labor, exposed to the ferocity of the lawless savages, the vicissitudes of weather and climate, and dependent on chance or accident alone for food, raiment or relief in the event of malady. These people are principally the descendants of the Canadian French, and it is not an inconsiderable proportion of them that can boast a small dash of the pure blood of the aborigines of America. On consulting with my friend Capt. C. I found it necessary that we should postpone our departure until 2 P.M. the next day and accordingly gave orders to the party to hold themselves in readiness to depart at that hour.—</p>
                        <p>Captain Clark now informed me that having gotten all the stores on board the Barge and pirogues on the evening of the 13th of May he determined to leave our winter cantonment at the mouth of River Dubois the next day, and to ascend the Missouri as far as the Village of St. Charles, where as it had been previously concerted between us, he was to wait my arrival; this movement while it advanced us a small distance on our route, would also enable him to determine whether the vessels had been judiciously loaded and if not timely to make the necessary alterations; accordingly at 4 P.M. on Monday the 14th of May 1804, he embarked with the party in the presence of a number of the neighboring Citizens who had assembled to witness his departure. During the fore part of this day it rained excessively hard. In my last letter to the President dated at St. Louis I mentioned the departure of Capt. Clark from River Dubois on the 15th Inst, which was the day that had been calculated on, but having completed the arrangements a day earlier he departed on the 14th as before mentioned. On the evening of the 14th the party halted and encamped on the upper point of the first Island which lies near the Larboard shore, on the same side and nearly opposite the center of this Island a small Creek disembogues called Couldwater.</p>
                        <p>The course and distance of this day was West 4 Miles the Wind from N.E.</p>

I entered the Cave and proceeded about 100 Yards under the ground, and found from light which came from the 〈top〉 Mouth of the Cave a small spring in it. I think it one of the most remarkable Caves I ever saw in my travels. I should have proceeded further into the Cave, but it being dark towards the further end, and having no light, I was forced to return.— On my arriving at the River I found that Captains Lewis and Clark had proceeded on with the Boat, and had left a pettiauger and some hands waiting for me. On my hailing them, they came across for me. We then proceeded to camp, and took dinner, after which we proceeded on with the Pettiauger, the Barge having been gone about two hours, we followed on about two hours; and encamped for that night.</p>

The Osage river is 197 yards wide at its confluence with the Missouri, which, at this place, is 875 yards broad. The country on the south side is broken, but rich: and the land on the other of a most excellent quality. The two men who went by land with the horses, came to us here: they represented the land they had passed through as the best they had ever seen, and the timber good, consisting chiefly of oak, ash, hickory, and black walnut. They had killed in their way five deer. The periogue left at the mouth of Gaskenade river, came up with the man who had been lost. Here our hunters went out and killed three deer. The Osage nation of Indians live about two hundred miles up this river. They are of a large size and well proportioned, and a very warlike people.

                        <p>June 2nd— Took the Directions of Sun & moon &c &c. I measured the Osage & Missouri at this place made their width as follows, the Missouri 875 yards wide. The Osage River 397 yards wide, the distance between the 2 rivers 80 poles up is 40 poles. Took equal altitudes & Meridian altitude also—and made them. I ascended the hill in the point 80 poles from the point found it about 100 foot high, on the top is 2 graves, or mounds, a Delightful prospect from this hill which Commands both rivers. Drewyer & Shields came to the opposite Side today at Sunset we sent across & brought them over, they had been absent 7 Days Swam many creeks, much worsted. They informed us that the Country on both Sides of muddy river's to the hill called by the French. 3 miles below this place, a Small Prairies below the hill, 4 Deer Killed today I ascend a hill & after measuring the river &c.</p>

L. with Octant, back observation gave for altitude 37° 28' 00". Error of Octant 2° 00' 00" +. made Several other observations— I made an angle for the Width of the two rivers. The Missouri from the Point to the North Side is 875 yards wide the Osage River from the point to the S. E Side is 397 337 yards wide, the distance between the two rivers at the point of high Land (100 foot above the bottom) and 80 poles up the Missouri from the point is 40 poles, on the top of this high land of under which is a limestone rock two Mounds or graves are raised— I took Meridian altitude of the Suns from this point which Commands both rivers I had a delightful prospect of the Missouri up & down, also the Osage R. up. George Drewyer & John Shields who we had Sent with the horses by Land on the North Side joined us this evening much worsted, they being absent Seven Days depending on their gun, the greater part of the time rain, they were obliged to raft or Swim many Creeks, those men gave a flattering account of the Country Commencing below the first hill on the North Side and extending Parallel with the river for 30 or 40 miles. The Two Muddy rivers passing Through some fine Springs & Streams our hunters kill Several Deer today, Some Small licks on the S. E of the Osage River.</p>

This afternoon we had some difficulty in passing a sandbar, the tow-rope having broke; but by the exertions of those on board, the boat was brought to shore without injury. We encamped on the south side on a point at the confluence of the Canzan, or Kanzas river with the Missouri. It was agreed to remain here during the 27th and 28th where we pitched our tents and built bowers in front of them. Canzan or Kanzas, is 230 yards and a quarter wide, and navigable to a great distance. Our hunters killed 4 deer, and a young wolf, and caught another alive. In the afternoon of the 29th we again proceeded on our voyage, and encamped on the north side of the river.</p>

                        <p>Independence Day, in the United States, the annual celebration of nationhood. It commemorates the passage of the Declaration of Independence by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776.</p>
                        <p>Declaration of Independence</p>
                        <p>The Congress had voted in favour of independence from Great Britain on July 2 but did not actually complete the process of revising the Declaration of Independence, originally drafted by Thomas Jefferson in consultation with fellow committee members John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and William Livingston, until two days later. The celebration was initially modeled on that of the king’s birthday, which had been marked annually by bell ringing, bonfires, solemn processions, and oratory. Such festivals had long played a significant role in the Anglo-American political tradition. Especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, when dynastic and religious controversies racked the British Empire (and much of the rest of Europe), the choice of which anniversaries of historic events were celebrated and which were lamented had clear political meanings. The ritual of toasting the king and other patriot-heroes—or of criticizing them—became an informal kind of political speech, further formalized in mid-18th century when the toasts given at taverns and banquets began to be reprinted in newspapers.</p>

This River is about 80 yards wide with a gentle Current and heads up near the Pawnee Village on River Blue a branch of Kansas, a little timbered land near the mouth for 1 mile above, only a few Trees, and thickets of Plums, Cherries &c are Seen on its banks, the Creeks & little ravines making into the river have also Some timber—    I got grapes on the banks nearly ripe, observed great quantities, of Grapes, plums, Crab apples and a wild Cherry, Growing like a Common Wild Cherry only larger & grows on a Small bush, on the side of a cliff Sand Stone.

                        <p>Point of observation No. 20.) Sunday July 15th    On the upper point of an Island mentioned in the 2ed & 3rd course of this day.</p>
                        <p>Observed meridian Altitude of Sun's Lower Limb with Octant by back observation. 42' 11' —" Latitude deduced from this observation. 40° 8' 31.8"</p>
                        <p>This evening I discovered that my Chronometer had stopped, nor can I assign any cause for this accident; she had been wound up the preceding noon as usual. This is the third instance in which the instrument has stopped in a similar manner since she has been in my possession, though the first only since our departure from the River Dubois. in the two preceding cases when she was again set in motion, and her rate of going determined by a series of equal altitudes of the Sun taken for that purpose, it was found to be the same precisely as that mentioned in the preliminary remarks [i.e., July 22, 1804, below] to these observations, or 15 s & 5 tenths too slow in 24 h—as her rate of going after stopping, and beginning again set in motion has in two instances proved to be the same, I have concluded, that whatever this impediment may proceed from, it is not caused by any material injury which her works have sustained, and that when she is in motion, her error on mean time above stated, may be depended on as accurate. In consequence of the chronometer's having thus accidentally stopped, I determined to come too at the first convenient place and make such observations as were necessary to ascertain her error, establish the Latitude & Longitude, and determine the variation of the needle, in order to fix a second point of departure. accordingly on [see Lewis's observation for July 16 below, where this note continues]</p>
