                <p>Still in her teens, Sacagewea was made to join the expedition by her husband who had forced her into a non-consensual marriage. Her husband lied about fluency in Native languages, so Sacagewea was forced to interpret in his stead. She was pregnant through the journey and gave birth in February 1805. Though often depicted as giving directions in modern retellings of the expedition, Sacagewa's main role was interpreting, and her presence signalled peaceful intent to native tribes encounted by the troupe.</p>
