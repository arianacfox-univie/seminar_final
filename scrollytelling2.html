                        <p>July 18th Wednesday 1804</p>
                        <p>A fair morning. The river falling fast. Set out this morning at sunrise under a gentle breeze from the S. E. by S. passing over the Prairie. At about 3 Miles we passed the head of the Island L. S. Called by the French Chaube or Bald pate. Opposite the middle of This Island the Creek on the S. S. is nearest the river. In high water an Island is formed in the bend above the last. Measured the Current and found that in forty-one Seconds it ran 50 fathoms. But little timber is to be seen except in the low points on Islands & on Creeks. The growth of timber is generally cotton, mulberry, elm, sycamore, &c. We passed an Island on the 2d point to the S. S. opposite the water when high passes out in the plain. Opposite this Island on the L. S. the hills jut to the river. This Hill has Slipped from the top which forms a Bluff above & 200 foot above the water, about ¾ of a mile in length & about 200 feet in Depth has Slipped into the river. It is composed of sandstone intermixed with an indifferent iron ore. Near the bottom or next to the water is a Soft Slate Stone. Some pebbles are also intermixed. We passed a very bad Sand bar and encamped on the L. S. at the lower point of the oven Islands & opposite the Prairie called by the French Four le Tourtue [Baker's oven]. Saw a Dog nearly Starved on the bank, gave him Some meat, he would not follow. Our hunters killed 2 Deer today</p>

                        <p>Wednesday July 18th 1804.    We set out at sunrise under a gentle breeze from the S. E. by S.    A fair morning. We proceeded on along this prairie. Passed several Islands. The current of the river runs 50 fathom in 41 seconds. There is but little timber on either side of the river, except the Islands and points which are low wet & covered with lofty trees: cottonwood, mulberry, elm, &c. &c.    We passed hill prairies, and a place in a high bank where some appearance of iron ore where the bank slipped into the river about 200 feet high.    We camped on the South Side of the Missouri.    Towards night we saw an Indian dog on the bank of the River, which appeared to have been lost. Drewyer joined us with 2 Deer this evening late.</p>

                        <p>Wednesday July 18th 1804.    We set out at Sun Rise. The day Clear wind fair. Sailed the Side of the Prairie. Here we toed for about 5 or 6 miles. The Elk Sign is very plenty. Deer is not as plenty as it was below. Passed Some High Clifts on the South Side Which have the appearance of Iron ore. The Clay is Red. Passed a very Strong pace of Water. Saw a Dog on the Bank Which we Suppose to be Indians had been Lost. This is the first Sign of Indians we have Saw. Camped on the South Side. The Land is Low. That on the N. Side is prairie Land</p>

                        <p>Wednesday 18th.    Early this morning we prosecuted our voyage with a fair wind and pleasant weather. This is the most open country I ever beheld, almost one continued prairie. Two of our hunters went by land with the horses as usual. On the south side we passed high handsome banks or bluffs of red and blue strata; found some iron ore here, and encamped on the south side, where one of the hunters brought us two deer.</p>

                        <p>Wednesday 18    The Morning was Clear. Got under way at day light. The wind blew fair. Sailed. 13 miles Before Dinner.    Passed. an Iron ore Mine on the Bank of the River on the W. S.—    Went 22 Miles—    The hunters brought 2 deer in with them</p>

                        <b>Summary</b>
                        <p>On July 18th, 1804, the expedition continued its journey along the river, passing various landmarks such as islands, sandbars, and points. They encountered a dog that seemed to have been abandoned and fed it. Hunters brought in fresh game, and they noted geological features such as sandstone cliffs and iron ore deposits. The landscape consisted mostly of prairie with sparse timber along the riverbanks and on islands.</p>

                        <p>Set out early. Passed between two Small Islands, one in the middle of the river, the other Close on the L S. opposite a prairie S. S. Called by the French Four le tourtre, The Bakers oven Islands. Passed Some high Cliffs 4½ miles above the Islands on the L. S. of yellow earth. Passed several Sand bars that were wide and at one place very shallow. Two Small butifull runs fall into the river near each other at this Clift, a Deer Lick 200 yards up the Lowest of those runs. Those runs head at no great distance in the plains and pass through timber to the river. In my walk on Shore, I found some ore in the bank above those runs which I take to be Iron ore. At this place the Side of the hill has Slipped about half way into the river for ¾ of a Mile forming a Clift from the top of the hill above. In the first bend to the right passed a Small Island a Sand bar opposite. Worthey of remark as we approach this great River Plate the Sand bars much more numerous and the quick or moving Sands much worse than they were below. At the places where Prairies approach the river, it is very wide, those places being much easier to wash & undermine than the woodlands. Passed a Willow Isd. Situated near the Middle of the river and a large Sand making out from the S. S. a Deep bend to the L S. We camped at the head of this Island on the Starboard Side of it, Hunters Killed Two Deer. Saw great numbers of young Geese. River falling a little.</p>

                        <p>Thursday July 19th 1804.    Set out early.    Between 2 Islands passed a place called Bakers oven & an Island called Bakers Island. We passed the mouth of a Small creek in a bend above high cliffs on the South Side. Passed high land along the South Side forming cliffs to the river of yellow earth. Prairies on the top. We saw some signs of Elk. We gathered a quantity of cherries at noon time & put in to the Whiskey barrel. We proceeded on. Passed several Sand bars & Islands and we camped on the north Side of a willow Island which is in a round bend of the river. G. Drewyer joined us with 2 Deer this evening. Bratton also. He found Callimous opposite where we camped & a large quantity. (Sweet flag we call it)</p>

                        <p>July 20th Friday 1804, a fog this morning and very cool. George Drewyer Sick. Proceeded over a Sand bar, Bratten swam the river to get his gun & clothes left last night. Passed a large willow Island on the L. S. (1) and the mouth of l'Eau que pleure, the English of which is the water which Cry's. This Creek is about 20 yards wide and falls into the river above a Clift of brown Clay L. S. opposite a willow Island. At this Creek, I went on shore took R Fields with me and went up this Creek Several miles & crossed through the plains to the river above with the view of finding Elk. We walked all day through those prairies without Seeing any. I killed an immense large yellow Wolf. The Country through which we walked after leaving the Creek was good land covered with Grass interspersed with Groves & Scattering timber near and about the heads of Branches.</p>

                        <p>Friday July 20th 1804. A heavy dew last night. Some foggy this morning. We set out at sunrise. Sergeant Pryor & Jo Fields went on shore with the horses. George Drewyer sick. We passed a fine spring running out of a high cliff of Rocks consisting of limestone and Iron ore. Little above we passed weeping water Creek or the creek which cries. Captain Clark & R. Fields went on shore after breakfast, passed prairies on both sides of the Missouri, passed handsome high prairies all along the east side. Passed several runs. Captain Clark found an excellent spring on the south side, near a small pond in sight of the river. We passed several islands & sand bars and camped on the south side nearly under a high hill prairie which appeared beautiful. Jo. Fields killed 2 Deer today & brought them in.</p>

It comes in above Cliffs opposite a willow Island. At this Cliff, there is a fine Spring. On the top of this Hill is open prairie. Passed a Creek on the North Side called Piggen Creek. The Land is Low. That on the South is High prairie Land. Passed several bad Sand Bars. Camped on the South Side under a Large Hill.</p>

The breadth of this creek at its mouth is 20 Yards wide lying on the South Side of the River. At the Southwest side under a bald hill at One o'Clock came to a large open Prairie, near the River Plate; the land lies high at this place, and is very rich; having some Groves of large timber, we continued rowing till towards Evening, and encamped on an Island. The hunters came to us having killed 2 Deer. This day we rowed 17 Miles.</p>

                        <b>Lewis</b>
                        <p>July 21st, 1804</p>
                        <p>By a boiling motion or ebullition of its waters, occasioned no doubt by the rolling and irregular motion of the sand of which its bed is entirely composed, the particles of this sand being remarkably small and light, it is easily boiled up and hurried by this impetuous torrent in large masses from place to place with irresistible force, collecting and forming sandbars in the course of a few hours which are suddenly dissipated to form others and give place perhaps to the deepest channel of the river. Where it enters the Missouri, its superior force changes and directs the current of that river against its northern bank where it is compressed within a channel less than one third of the width it had just before occupied. It does not furnish the Missouri with its coloring matter as has been asserted by some, but it throws into it immense quantities of sand and gives a celerity to its current of which it abates but little until its junction with the Mississippi. The water of this river is turbid at all seasons of the year but is by no means as much so as that of the Missouri. The sediment it deposits consists of very fine particles of white sand while that of the Missouri is composed principally of a dark rich loam in much greater quantity.</p>
                        <p>We made some experiments to determine the velocity of the current of the Missouri in different parts. From the experiments and observations we were enabled to make with respect to the comparative velocities of the currents of the rivers Mississippi, Missouri, and Platte, it results that a vessel will float in the Mississippi about below the entrance of the Missouri at the rate of four miles an hour. In the Missouri from its junction with the Mississippi to the entrance of the Osage river from 5½ to 6, from thence to the mouth of the Kansas from 6½ to 7, from thence to the Platte 5½, while the Platte is at least 8. The Missouri above the junction of the river Platte is equal to about 3½ miles an hour as far as the mouth of the Cheyenne where its current still abates and becomes equal to about three miles an hour.</p>

                        <p>July 21st, Saturday 1804</p>
                        <p>Set out early under a gentle breeze from the S. E. proceeded on very well, passed a willow Island on the L. S. opposite a bad Sand bar, Some high lands covered with timber L. S. In this hill is limestone & Cemented rock of shells &c. in high water the opposite side is cut through by several small channels, forming Small Islands, a large Sand bar opposite the Hill. At 7 o'clock the wind lulled and it commenced raining, arrived at the lower Mouth of the Great River Platt at 10 o'clock. This Great river being much more rapid than the Missouri forces its current against the opposite Shore, The Current of This river Comes with great Velocity rolling its Sands into the Missouri, filling up its Bend & Compelling it to encroach on the North Shore. We found great difficulty in passing around the Sand at the mouth of this River. Capt. Lewis and myself with 6 men in a pirogue went up this Great river Plate about one mile, found the Current very rapid rolling over Sands, passing through different Channels none of them more than five or six feet deep, about 600 yards wide at the mouth. I am told by one of our Party who wintered two winters on This river that "it is much wider above, and does not rise more than five or six feet" Spreads very wide with many Small islands scattered through it and from its rapidity & rolling Sands Cannot be navigated with Boats or Perogues. The Indians pass this river in Skin Boats which are flat and will not turn over. The Ottoes, a Small nation reside on the South Side 10 Leagues up, the Pawnees on the Same Side 5 Leagues higher up. About 10 Leagues up this river on the South Side a Small river comes into the Platte Called Salt River, "The waters so brackish that it can't be drank at Some Seasons." Above this river & on the North Side a Small river falls into the Platte Called Elk River. This river runs parallel with the Missouri. At 3 miles passed a Small river on the L. S. Called Papillion or Butterfly Creek, 18 yards wide, a large Sand bar off the mouth, we proceeded on to get to a good place to Camp and Delay a few days, passed around this Sand bar and Came to for the night on the L. S. a very hard wind from the N. W. I went on Shore S. S. and proceeded up one mile through high Bottom land open a Great number of wolves about us this evening.</p>

                        <p>Saturday July 21st 1804. Some Rain this morning. We set out at Sun rise under a gentle breeze from the South or S. E. we proceeded on very well, passed several islands &c. Some high lands covered with Timber. In this hill is Cemented rock & Limestone. Some fine Springs &c. we arrived at the mouth of the Platte River S. S. about 1 o'clock. This River runs out and forms Several large Sand bars thrown out by the Platte River. There is Some high handsome prairies about this River, the Rapidity of the River Platte which is much greater than that of the Missouri, its width at the mouth across the bars is about ¾ of a mile, higher up we are told by one of our French Bowman that he was 2 years up or on this River and that it does not rise four feet but spreads open 3 miles at Some places, we proceeded on round a large Sand bar S. S. a hard head wind from N. W. we put below [past?] the last mentioned Sand Bar we passed a creek on S. S. called Pappeo R. prairies in part between the Missouris & the Great River Platte but flat Subject to overflow. Some large cottonwood Timber but thin on the point. we camped on the South Side of the River, a prairie on the North Side of the Missouris. The party who were with the Horses joined us with four Deer.</p>

                        <p>A summary discription of the apparatus employed in the following observations; containing also some remarks on the manner in which they have been employed, and the method observed in recording the observations made with them.—</p>
                        <p>1st— a brass Sextant of 10 Inches radius, graduated to 15' which by the assistance of the nonius was devisible to 15"; and half of this sum by means of the micrometer could readily be distinguished, therefore—7.5" of an angle was perceptible with this instrument: she was also furnished with three eye-pieces, consisting of a hollow tube and two telescopes one of which last reversed the images of observed objects. finding on experiment that the reversing telescope when employed as the eye-piece gave me a more full and perfect image than either of the others, I have most generally imployed it in all the observations made with this instrument; when thus prepared I found from a series of observations that the quantity of her index error was 8' 45" —; this sum is therefore considered as the standing error of the instrument unless otherwise expressly mentioned. the altitudes of all objects, observed as well with this instrument as with the Octant were by means of a reflecting surface; and those stated to have been taken with the sextant are the degrees, minutes, &c shewn by the graduated limb of the instrument at the time of observation and are of course the double altitudes of the objects observed.</p>
                        <p>2ed— A common Octant of 14 Inches radius, graduated to 20', which by means of the nonius was devisbile to 1', half of this sum, or 30" was perceptible by means of a micrometer. this instrument was prepared for both the fore and back observation; her error in the fore observation is 2° +, & and in the back observtion 2° 11' 40.3" +</p>
                        <p>at the time of our departure from the River Dubois untill the present moment, the sun's altitude at noon has been too great to be reached with my sextant, for this purpose I have therefore employed the Octant by the back observation. the degrees ' & " , recorded for ths sun's altitude by the back observation express only the angle given by the graduated limb of the instrument at the time of observation, and are the complyment of the double Altitude of the sun's observed limb; if therefore the angle recorded be taken from 180° the remainder will be the double altitude of the observed object, or that which would be given by the fore observation with a reflecting surface.</p>
                        <p>3rd— An Artificial Horizon on the construction recommended and practiced by Mr. Andrw. Ellicott of Lancaster, Pensyla., in which water is used as the reflecting surface; believing this artificial Horizon liable to less error than any other in my possession, I have uniformly used it when the object observed was sufficiently bright to reflect a distinct immage; but as much light is lost by reflection from water I found it inconvenient in most cases to take the altitude of the moon with this horizon, and that of a star impracticable with any degree of accuracy.</p>
                        <p>4th— An Artificial Horizon constructed in the manner recommended by Mr. Patterson of Philadelphia; glass is here used as the reflecting surface. this horizon consists of a glass plane with a single reflecting surface, cemented to the flat side of the larger segment of a wooden ball; adjusted by means of a sperit-level and a triangular stand with a triangular mortice cut through it's center sufficiently large to admit of the wooden ball partially; the stand rests on three screws inserted near it's angles, which serve as feet for it to rest on while they assist also in the adjustment. this horizon I have employed in taking the altitude of the sun when his image he has been reather too dull for a perfect reflection from water; I have used it generally in taking the altitude of the moon, and in some cases of the stars also; it gives the moon's image very perfectly, and when carefully adjusted I consider it as liable to but little error.—</p>
                        <p>5th— An Artificial Horizon formed of the index specula of a Sextant cemented to a flat board; adjusted by means of a sperit level and the triangular stand before discribed. as this glass reflects from both surfaces it gives the images of all objects much more bright than either of the other horizons; I have therefore most generally employed it in observing the altitudes of stars—</p>
                        <p>6th— A Chronometer; her ballance-wheel and [e]scapement were on the most improved construction. she rested on her back, in a small case prepared for her, suspended by an universal joint. she was carefully wound up every day at twelve oclock. Her rate of going as asscertained by a series of observations made by myself for that purpose was found to be 15 Seconds and a 5 tenths of a second too slow in twenty four howers on Mean Solar time. This is nearly the same result as that found by Mr. Andrew Ellicott who was so obliging as to examine her rate of going for the space of fourteen days, in the summer 1803. her rate of going as ascertained by that gentleman was 15.6 s too slow M. T. in 24 h. and that she went from 3 to 4 s. slower the last 12 h, than she did the first 12 h. after being wound up.—</p>
                        <p>at 12 OCk. on the 14th day of may 1804 (being the day on which the detachment left the mouth of the River Dubois) the Chronometer was too fast M. T. 6 m. 32 s. & 2/10.— This time-piece was regulated on mean time, and the time entered in the following observations is that shewn by her at the place of observation. the day is recconed on Civil time, (i e) commencing at midnight.</p>
                        <p>7th— A Circumferentor, circle 6 Inches diameter, on the common construction; by means of this instrument adjusted with the sperit level, I have taken the magnetic azimuth of the sun and pole Star. It has also been employed in taking the traverse of the river:— from the courses thus obtained, together with the distance estimated from point to point, the chart of the Missouri has been formed which now accompanys these observations. the several points of observation are marked with a cross of red ink, and numbered in such manner as to correspond with the celestial observations made at those points respectively.</p>

                        <p>Sunday 22nd. We left the river Platte and proceeded early on our voyage, with fair weather. There is high prairie land on the south side, with some timber on the northern parts of the hills. We came nine miles from the mouth of Platte river, and landed on a willow bank. The hunters killed five deer and caught two beaver.</p>

                        <p>at 4 oClock Set out under a gentle Breeze from the S. E proceeded on N. 5° E 5 Ms. Passed a Pt. on the S. S. and round a large Sand bar on the L.

                        <p>The Osage & Kansies are the Same language</p>
                        <p>the Ottoes & Mahars Speak many words of the Osarge language</p>
                        <p>The Ottos, Aiaways, & Missouries Speak the Same language</p>

                        <p>The Probability is that those different tribes have once formed 〈one〉 3 great nats. Viz: the Missouries, Osarge, Kanzes, Ottoes, Mahars, & Poncaras & Aiauaies one nation.</p>

                        <p>It is possible that the 〈Mandain〉, Mahar & Poncarear may have been a Distinct nation, as they only Speak Some words of the Osage which have the Same Signification</p>

                        <p>August 4th, at 7 o'clock, the heavens darkened and a violent wind from the N.W. succeeded, lasting about half an hour, with a little rain. Set out early through a narrow part of the channel, crowded with Snags. At 1½ miles, passed an old trading house on the L. S., where one of our crew, Pierre Cruzatte, traded with the Mahars and Ponies. Above 1 mile, a Creek comes in opposite a large sandbar. This Creek is the outlet of 3 ponds, which receive their water from smaller streams running from the hills on the L. S. Saw great quantities of geese. Passed a small Creek on the L. S., about 3 miles above the last. Both of these Creeks are outlets from the small lake, which receives water from streams running from the high land. Many Pumey Stones found on the shore of various sizes. Wind a head. Reed, the man who went back to the camp for his knife, has not joined us. Camped at a point on the L. S. at a beaver house. One buck killed today.</p>

Set out early this morning. Proceeded through a narrow part of the river filled with snags and logs, confined in many places within 200 yards. Reed went back for his knife. Passed an old trading house where one of our party stayed 2 years trading with the Mahars and Ponies. Above that, passed a Small Creek which comes in behind a large sandbar. This Creek is the outlet of 3 ponds which make in from towards the hills. The bottom and high prairies extend along both sides of the river most of this day's march. Some young groves of cottonwood on the points. We rowed 10½ miles and camped on the S. S. on a high bank of willows.</p>

Passed a Creek on the South Side, called Fish Creek Council or Pond, as it has no name, and the council was held below it about 7 miles. This Creek comes out of a large pond which lies under the high prairie hills. The woodland is not plenty here, only along the river banks in places. Passed some bad sandbars. Encamped on the South Side. A large prairie. That on the North is prairie land.</p>

                        <p>Set out early with wind from N.E. Great appearance of wind & rain. A very large Snake called the Bull Snake was killed today, somewhat lighter in color than a rattlesnake. The bends of the river today are washing away the banks, having nothing to oppose the turbulence of the river when confined by large hard Sand Points, forcing this current against the bends. The entire bottom soil between the highland, being the mud or ooze of the river from some former period mixed with sand & clay easily melts and slips or washes into the river. Camped on the S. S. I went on shore S. S. this evening, saw some turkeys and in pursuing them struck the river 12 miles below. I think the Peninsula is about 370 yards across subject to overflow and washes into numerous channels. Great quantities of grapes ripe & of three different kinds. Killed a turkey and made camp in the night, mosquitoes very troublesome. Reed, the man who went back for his knife, has not yet joined us.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Lewis]</strong></p>
                        <p>Killed a serpent [Pituophis melanol] on the bank of the river adjoining a large prairie.</p>
                        <p>Length from nose to tail: 5 feet 2 inches<br>Circumference in largest part: 4½ inches<br>Number of scuta on belly: 221<br>Number on tail: 53<br>No poison teeth, therefore think him perfectly innocent. Eyes center black with a border of pale brown yellow. Color of skin on head yellowish-green with black specks on the extremity of the scuta which are pointed or triangular. Color of back, transverse stripes of black and dark brown of an inch in width, succeeded by a yellowish-brown of half that width. The end of the tail hard and pointed like a cock's spur. The sides are speckled with yellowish-brown and black. Two rows of black spots on a light yellow ground pass throughout his whole length on the upper points of the scuta of the belly and tail ½ inch apart. This snake is vulgarly called the cow or bull snake from a bellowing noise which it is said sometimes to make resembling that animal. I have frequently observed an aquatic bird [Sterna antillarum] in the course of ascending this river but have never been able to procure one before today. The weight of the male bird is one ounce and a half, its length from beak to toe 7½ inches, from tip to tip of wing across the back one foot seven inches and a half. The beak is one ⅛ inch long, large where it joins the head, flatted on the sides and tapering to a sharp point, a little declining and curved. A fine yellow with a shade of black on the extremity of upper beak. The eye is prominent, black, and on an angular scale of ½ inch, occupies 3⅓ inches in width. The upper part of the head is black from the beak as low as the middle of the eye and a little below the joining of the neck except, however, some white which joins the upper part of the beak and extends, which forks and passing over the sides of the forehead terminate above each eye. The under part of the bird, that is the throat and cheeks as high as the eye, the neck breast belly and under part of the wings and tail are of a fine white, the upper part of the neck, back, and wings are of a fine quaker color, or bright dove color with rather more of a bluish tint, except, however, the three first or larger feathers in the wing which on the upper side are of a deep black. The wing has four joints...</p>

                        <p>At 12 o'clock last night, a violent storm of wind and rain from the N.W. One perogue lost her colors. Set out early and proceeded on, passed a large island on the S.S. Back of this island, Rivie de Soldiert comes in on the S.S. The Soldier's River is about the size of Nodaway, 20 yards wide at the mouth. Passed two remarkable places where the river had once passed. We believe that one man, Moses B. Reed, has deserted. Also, one Frenchman we sent to the Indian camps has not joined us. Determined to send back 4 men to take Reed dead or alive, also hunt La Liberty and to meet us at the Mahar nation as soon as the order is executed.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Ordway]</strong></p>
                        <p>A violent storm came up about 12 o'clock last night of wind & rain from N.W. We set out early this morning, passed a large island on the N.S. Back of this island comes in a creek called the Soldiers River on N.S. as big as the Nodaway River at the mouth. Passed round bends & sandbars & a prairie on S.S. & groves of cottonwood on the bank, on N.S. near the river is a spit of cottonwood timber but prairies back of that generally. M.B. Reed who went back on 4th ult has not returned yet nor La Liberty who went for the Indians has not returned. We came 20½ miles this day & camped on the S.S. of the river. George Drewyer joined us this afternoon & fetched 2 deer & one fawn & c.</p>

                        <p>Set out early this morning, proceeded on, passed a creek on the N. side called Soldiers Creek. It comes in back of an island near the N.S. About 12 o'clock last night a violent storm of wind and rain from the N.W. Camped on the south side. The land low, that on the N.S. the same.</p>

                        <p>This morning being fair, we got underway at sunrise, and passed an island lying on the southwest side of the river. We rowed 12 miles by dinner, the hunters brought 3 deer to the river. We encamped on the southwest side of the river in the evening having rowed 18¾ miles this day.</p>

                        <p>Last night around 8 o'clock, a storm from the N.W. of wind and rain lasted about ¾ of an hour. Mosquitoes very troublesome last night. Set out late this morning, the wind from the North. Sent G. Drewyer, W. Bratton, R. Fields, and W. Labuche back to the Ottoes village after M.B. Reed who had deserted, with orders to fetch him dead or alive, and to look for La Liberty who was lost. Proceeded on about 18 miles and camped on the N.S. of the Missouri.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Floyd]</strong></p>
                        <p>Set out at 6 o'clock A.M., proceeded on, day clear, wind from the Northwest. On the 4th of this month, one of our men, Moses B. Reed, went back to our camp where we had left in the morning to get his knife, which he had left at the camp. The boat went on and he did not return. On examining his nap-sack, we found that he had taken his clothes and all his powder and balls, and had hidden them out that night and had made that an excuse to desert from us without any just cause. We never minded the said man until the 7th. Sent 4 men after him, expecting he will make for the Otoe town as it is not more than 2 days' journey from where he ran away from us. Made 16 miles, camped on the north side at some wood land.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Gass]</strong></p>
                        <p>We set out early this morning and continued our voyage till 12 when four of our people were dispatched to the Oto nation of Indians after the man who had not returned on the 4th, with orders to take him, dead or alive, if they could see him. Encamped on the north side. The mosquitoes here are very numerous and troublesome.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Whitehouse]</strong></p>
                        <p>Nothing extraordinary happened this day. Captain Lewis sent out 4 men to find Read who had deserted. This place is a prairie, and the land is very rich; nothing extraordinary happened this day.</p>

                        <p><strong>[Clark]</strong></p>
                        <p>Set out this morning at the usual time. Passed a bend to the L.S. choked up with snags. Wind from N.W. Passed the mouth of a river on the S. Side called by the Sioux Indians Eă-neăh Wáu de pón (or Stone river). It is about 80 yards wide and navigable for perogues some distance. Two miles above is an island, the channel formerly ran on the right but is now nearly filled up with sand. Current runs to the left. Many hundreds of pelicans on the shore of this island, which we call Pelican Island. Capt. Lewis killed one. The river Sioux, called by the Sioux Eá-Neah Wau-de-pon, heads in three leagues of the river Des Moines and passes through a lake about 20 leagues in circumference, which is also within 5 leagues of the Des Moines. This lake, at one place, is confined by two rocks within a narrow space. From the lake to the Mahas about 4 days' march, to the Dog Plains 90 leagues. One principal branch of the Des Moines is called Cat river. The Des Moines is shallow. Capt. Lewis took meridian altitude of the sun, making latitude 41° 42' 34". I went on shore and a man killed an elk. I fired 4 times at one but did not kill it. The mosquitoes were so bad in the prairies that I couldn't keep them out of my eyes. Camped on the S.S. worth remarking that snakes are not plenty in this part of the Missouri.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Lewis]</strong></p>
                        <p>Saw a great number of feathers floating down the river. Those feathers covered pretty generally sixty or seventy yards of the breadth of the river for three miles. Surprised by the appearance of a flock of pelicans on a sand bar. They appeared to cover several acres of ground and left several small fish behind them. The pelicans rested again on a sand bar above the island which we called Pelican Island. I shot one and made a description of it.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Ordway]</strong></p>
                        <p>Set out at the usual time. Passed a part of the river choked up with logs and snags. Wind from N.W. One of the soldiers killed a pelican on a sand island. Passed the mouth of Little River des Cueoux or Stone River on the N.S. Capt. Clark and Collins went hunting. Collins killed an elk. The captain shot several times at one but did not kill it. Saw sand bars covered with pelicans. Camped on the N.S. of the Missouri River at a willow bank.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Floyd]</strong></p>
                        <p>Set out early, day clear, wind from N.W. Passed the mouth of the Little Sioux River on the N. side. It is about 80 yards wide and navigable for boats for some distance in the country. Saw a great number of pelicans on a sand bar. Captain Clark went out hunting and Collins killed an elk. Camped on the N. side.</p>

                        <p>Captain Lewis shot a pelican, the bag which it carried its drink in contained 5 gallons of water by measure. Passed Pelican Island where we saw a very considerable number of pelicans flying. Camped on the E. S. Rowed 19 miles, camped on the N. side, having rowed 19 miles this day.</p>

                        <p>At 12 o'clock, the party sent yesterday to the towns returned and informed that they could not find any Indians; they had not returned from hunting the buffalo in the prairies. Wind shifted to the northwest. Our party sent after the deserter and to the Otteau towns have not come up as yet.</p>
                        <p>The situation of this village, now in ruins, surrounded by innumerable hosts of graves, the ravages of the Small Pox (4 years ago). They follow the buffalo and tend no corn.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Lewis]</strong></p>
                        <p>A fine morning, wind from the southeast. The men sent to the Mahar Town last evening have not returned. We conclude to send a spy to know the cause of their delay. At about 12 o'clock, the party returned and informed us that they could not find the Indians nor any fresh sign. Those people have not returned from their buffalo hunt. Those people having no houses, no corn, or anything more than the graves of their ancestors to attach them to the old village, continue in pursuit of the buffalo longer than others who had greater attachments to their native village. The ravages of the Small Pox (about 4 years ago) has reduced this nation to not exceeding 300 men and left them to the insults of their weaker neighbors, which before were glad to be on friendly terms with them.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Ordway]</strong></p>
                        <p>We set out at light and walked along down the hills past the graves. We saw also a number of large holes in the ground where they used to hide their peltry, etc. We walked along the ridge which is high prairie all back as far as my eye could behold. We expected to have found some corn or something growing somewhere in the bottom but we could not see any appearance of anything being planted this year. We returned to the boats about 10 o'clock A.M. Grapes are very plenty near the Missouri River.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Floyd]</strong></p>
                        <p>Lay by for our men how we had sent after the deserter on the 7th. These Indians only live at this village, has not lived at the town since the Smallpox was so bad about 4 years ago. They burnt their town and only live about it in the winter and in the spring go all of them in the prairies after the buffalo and does not return until the fall to meet the French traders. They raise no corn nor anything except sometimes they raise some corn and then the Ottoe nation comes and cuts it down while they are in the prairies.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Gass]</strong></p>
                        <p>The sergeant and man returned from the village, but they had found no Indians there. Some of our hunters went out but killed nothing. Game appears scarce here. While at this place we provided ourselves with a new mast.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Whitehouse]</strong></p>
                        <p>The day was fair and pleasant. Some of the men went hunting but returned found no game.</p>

                        <p>I took ten men and went out to Beaver Dam across a Creek about a mile SW from Camp, and with a Brush Drag caught 308 fish, of the following kind: Pike, Salmon, Bass, Perch, Red Horse, Small Cat, and a kind of Perch Called Silverfish. I also caught the Shrimp which is common to the Lower part of the Mississippi, in this Creek and in the Beaver Pond is immense beads of Mussels very large & fat. In my absence, Captain Lewis sent the Sioux interpreter Dorion and a party to a smoke which appeared to rise at no great distance to the north with a view to find Some Band of that nation. They returned and informed that the fires had been made Some time by Some Small party, and the hard wind of today had set the Prairie on fire from Some high trees, which was left burning. All well, Party from Ottoes not come up.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Lewis]</strong></p>

Captain Clark and 10 of the party went out to the Mahar Creek in order to catch Some fish & they caught & brought in upwards of 300 different sorts of fine fish. Some Salmon, Some bass, pike, etc. We saw smoke arise on the North Side of the Missouri River. 4 men went over to see if there were any Indians, they returned without finding any Indians; hard wind from the northwest. A new mast made for the Batteaux today.</p>

                        <p>Captain Clarke and ten of the party went to the Maha creek to fish, and caught 387 fish of different kinds. We discovered smoke on the opposite side of the river, and four men crossed to see if any of the Mahas or Sioux Indians were there; but could not discover any. There had been fire there some days, and the wind lately blowing hard had caused the fire to spread and smoke to rise. We continued at this place until the 20th. Captain Lewis went with a party of twelve men to fish and took 709 fish, 167 of which were large pike. The fish here are generally pike, cat, sun perch, and other common fish.</p>
