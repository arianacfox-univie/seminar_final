                        <p>21st August Tuesday. We set out very early this morning under a gentle breeze from the S. E. Passed Willow Creek small on the S. S. below a bluff of about 170 feet high and one ½ miles above Floyd's river. At 1 ½ miles higher & above the bluff passed the Sioux River S. S. This River is about the size of Grand River and as Mr. Durrien, our Sioux interpreter says, "navigable to the falls 70 or 80 Leagues and above these falls still further, those falls are 200 feet or thereabouts & has two principal pitches, and heads with the St. Peters passing the head of the Demoin, on the right below the falls a Creek comes in which passed through Cliffs of red rock which the Indians make pipes of, and when the different nations meet at a sort of asylum for all nations, no fighting there, passed a place in a Prairie on the L. S. where the Mahars had a Village formerly. Camped on the L. Side."</p>

                        <p>Tuesday Augt. 21st. We set off early this morning under a hard breeze from the S. We proceeded on very well. Passed a large Sand bar on N. S. The wind blew so hard that we were obliged to take a reef in our Sail & the Sand blew so thick from the Sand bars that we could not see the channel far ahead & it filled the air before us about a mile. We saw several wolves on said Sand beach. We passed the Mouth of the Grand River de Sioux close above a high clay Bluff below said Sand bar on the N. S. The white pirogue could hardly sail for want of Ballast, we put in several kegs of pork &c. Shannon went out to hunt on N. S. We proceeded on 20 odd miles today & Camped on S. S. Shannon joined us late. But killed nothing. The man with the horses did not join us yet.</p>

                      <b>American Bison</b>
                      <p>Once roaming in vast herds, the species nearly became extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle. With an estimated population of 60 million in the late 18th century, the species was culled down to just 541 animals by 1889 as part of the subjugation of the Native Americans, because the American bison was a major resource for their traditional way of life (food source, hides for clothing and shelter, and horns and bones for tools).[5][6] Recovery efforts expanded in the mid-20th century, with a resurgence to roughly 31,000 wild bison as of March 2019.[7] For many years, the population was primarily found in a few national parks and reserves. Through multiple reintroductions, the species now freely roams wild in several regions in the United States, Canada and Mexico. American Bison have also been introduced to Yakutia in Russia.</p>

Continued S. 48° W. 2¼ miles to the Commencement of a Blue Clay Bluff on L S. about 180 or 190 feet high. West under rugged Bluffs 1¾ miles passing Several Small Drains falling into the river. Great appearance of Coal, & immense quantities of Cobalt on the bluff. Above this bluff I took my servant and a French boy and walked on shore. In the evening I killed two Buck Elk and wounded two others. It was late and I crossed a Point, struck the river above and halted the boat. All the after part of the day it rained. Capt. Lewis and myself concluded to visit a High Hill Situated in an immense Plain three Leagues N. 20° W. from the mouth of White Stone river. This hill appears to be of a Conic form and is supposed by different Nations to be a place of Deavels or that they are in human form with remarkable large heads and about 18 inches high. They are said to kill all persons who attempt to approach the hill.</p>

Some Small Sized timber on N. S. near the river. Smooth prairies back from the River. We halted, took Breakfast at high Ragged Bluffs on S. S. Along under those Bluffs we found a great quantity of red berries which grow on a handsome bush about as high as I could reach. These Berries are a little Sour (& are called Rabbit berries) (English) But pleasant to the taste. We found also a burning bank or Bluff which was very high & had fire in it. Captain Clark went out hunting on S. S. We proceeded on passed the upper end of the Beautiful Bottom prairie. There the high beautiful prairie commenced which is extensive & Smooth. We passed the mouth of White Stone River, which came in above the high prairie. Their is large points of land covered with Timber on both sides of the river. Captain Clark joined us towards evening had killed 2 Buck Elk & 1 faun. Captain Clark & Captain Lewis & 10 more of the party in order to fetch the meat in, they returned with the meat, which was jerked. At the Same time we had a fine Shower of Rain which lasted about half an hour, at which place we Camped on South Side. The Mosquitoes Troublesome.</p>

                        <p>This morning was cloudy with some rain. Captain Clarke went by land. We passed cedar bluffs on the north side, a part of which were burning; and there are here to be found mineral substances of various kinds. There is also a quantity of small red berries, the Indian name for which in English means rabbit berries. They are handsome small berries and grow upon bushes about 10 feet high. Captain Clarke came to us and had killed two elk and a fawn, we passed a creek called White-stone creek landed and remained here all night to jerk our meat.</p>

                        <p>The Maha Town is S. 45 E. Some high lands to be seen from the mound at a great distance to the N. E., some nearer to the N. W.; no woods except on the Missouri's points. If all the timber which is on the Stone Creek was on 100 acres it would not be thickly timbered. The soil of those Plains is delightful. Great numbers of Birds are seen in those Plains, such as black bird, wren or Prairie bird, a kind of lark about the size of a partridge with a short tail, etc.</p>
                        <p>25th Augt: The boat under the Command of Sergeant Pryor proceeded on in our absence (after jerking the Elk I killed yesterday) six miles and camped on the larboard side. R. Fields brought in five Deer. George Shannon killed an Elk Buck. Some rain this evening. We set the Prairies on fire as a signal for the Soues to come to the river.</p>
                        <p><strong>[Lewis]</strong></p>
                        <p>On our return from the mound of spirits saw the first bats that we had observed since we began to ascend the Missouri. Also saw on our return on the Creek that passes this mound about 2 miles distant S. a bird of heron kind as large as the Cormorant short tail long legs of a color on the back and wings deep copper brown with a shade of red. We could not kill it therefore I cannot describe it more particularly.</p>

                        <p>Saturday 25th: 2 men of the party caught 9 catfish last night 5 of them very large. A fair & pleasant morning. Capt. Lewis & Clark & 10 more of the party, I was with them. We went back to the mouth of White Stone or little peoples Rivers in the white pirogue and walked out to the hill of the little people. We walked hard 3 hours from the Missouri to get to the hill. When we came near the hill we saw a great flock of Birds flying about the top of it. We ascended the hill found none of the little people there. We saw several holes in the ground, some Stone piss ants, etc. We could see a great distance in every direction which the land is very Rich. High smooth prairies & some fine bottom. When we were on the Top of the hill of the little Devils (which is 60 feet high) we saw several gangs of Buffalo at a considerable distance from us. We were almost famished for the want of water. The Sun beat down very hot the air Sultry. We went the nighest course to the River of little children, from hence after we took a little refreshment. We proceeded on down that River & Struck our old track & returned back to the pirogue, about Sunset, we walked the whole day in the Beautiful prairie found Some plums & grapes, but little Timber. We returned back to the old Camp of last night & camped. The Big Boat had set off about 11 A. M. o'clock & proceeded on, we had a little rain this evening, we killed one duck & Several Birds only.</p>

                        <p>Saturday 25th: Two of our men last night caught nine catfish, that would together weigh three hundred pounds. The large catfish are caught in the Missouri with hook and line. Captain Lewis and Captain Clarke went to see a hill on the north side of the river where the natives will not or pretend that they will not venture to go, and say that a small people live there, whom they are afraid of. At 11 o'clock, the gentlemen not having returned, we set sail with a gentle breeze from the S. E. passed black bluffs on the south side, and continued on nine miles and encamped. Two of our hunters came in who had killed a large elk. Captains Lewis and Clarke did not return this evening.</p>

                        <p>Orders August 26th, 1804. The commanding officers have thought it proper to appoint Patric Gass, a Sergeant in the corps of volunteers for North Western Discovery, he is therefore to be obeyed and respected accordingly. Sergeant Gass is directed to take charge of the late Sergeant Floyd's mess, and immediately to enter on the discharge of such other duties as have been prescribed for the government of the Sergeants of this corps. The Commanding officers have every reason to hope from the previous faithful services of Sergeant Gass, that this expression of their approbation will be still further confirmed, by his vigilant attention in future to his duties as a Sergeant. The Commanding officers are still further confirmed in the high opinion they had previously formed of the capacity, diligence, and integrity of Sergeant Gass, from the wish expressed by a large majority of his comrades for his appointment as Sergeant.

                        <p>28th August Tuesday, 1804. The wind blew hard last night. One Indian stayed with us all night. Set out under a stiff breeze from the south and proceeded on. Passed a Willow Island at two miles, several sand bars. The river here is wide & shallow full of sand bars. The high land appears to be getting nearer to each other. Passed a bluff containing some white earth on the left side. Below this bluff for some mile the plain rises gradually to the height of the bluff which is 70 or 80 foot. Here the Indian boy left us for his camp. Capt. Lewis & myself much indisposed. I think from the honey we substitute in place of bread, or plums. We proceeded on about 3 miles higher and camped below the Calumet Bluff in a plain on the left side to wait the return of Sergeant Pryor & Mr. Durioun, who we sent to the Sioux camp from the mouth of River Jacque. Before we landed, the French ran a snag through their perogue, and like to have sunk. We had her unloaded, from an examination found that this perogue was unfit for service, & determined to send her back by the party intended to send back and take their perogue. Accordingly changed the loads. Some of the loading was wet. Wind blows hard from the south. J. Shields & J. Fields joined. They did not overtake Shannon with the horses who is ahead of us.</p>

The commanding officers direct that the two messes who form the crews of the perogues shall select each one man from their mess for the purpose of cooking and that these cooks as well as those previously appointed to the messes of the Barge crew, shall in future be exempted from mounting guard, or any detail for that duty; they are therefore no longer to be held on the roaster.

                        <p>Tuesday 28th: A pleasant morning. We set off early under a fine breeze from S. E. We proceeded on till breakfast time. We then halted at a large prairie N. S. The Indian left us in order to go to his camp. We proceeded on, passed handsome groves of cottonwood timber on both sides of the Missouri River, passed high banks, high prairie on N. S. handsome & ascending gradually from the river. At 2 o'clock P. M. the wind blew hard from S. W. The large perogue drove against the shore on N. S. & a hole got knocked in her so that it let the water in very rapid they began to unload. Capt. Clark went with some men from the big boat to their assistance. They stopped in a capote &c. & made it safe to cross. We then crossed the river on S. S. & camped to wait the arrival of the men who went for the Indians & the Indians in order to counsel with them. Some of the party went out hunting. We hoisted a flag pole, the 2 men who had been out to hunt for the horses returned to the boat, informed us that the horses & Shannon was gone ahead, we saw several large bucks run at a distance from our camp, this place is below a large island & sand bar a hill & bluff on the same side little above. Our camp was in the handsome bottom & groves of oak timber &c— appearance of rain.</p>

                        <p>Tuesday 28th. We set forward early. The day was pleasant, and a fair wind from S. E. At 8 we halted for breakfast, when our young Indian left us to go to his camp at a handsome prairie, gently rising from the river on the north side; a small distance above which are beautiful groves of Cotton wood on both sides of the river. About 12 one of the periogues run against a snag which broke a hole in it. We then crossed to the south side to mend the periogue, and to wait to receive the Indians we expected; and landed a little below some high bluffs. Our camp was in a wide bottom, in which are large elm and oak trees.</p>

                        <p>Tuesday 28th: We set off early under a fine breeze from S. E. We passed high prairies on N. S. handsome & ascending gradually from the river. At 2 o'clock P m. the wind blew hard from the S. W. the pearogue got a hole broke into her by dashing against a snag, so that they had to begin to unload, but they stopped the water from coming in by stopping in one thing & another. So we went across the river on the South Side and camped to wait the arrival of the Indians &c— in order to counsel with them &c— a flag pole raised. This place is below a large island & sand bar below a hill & bluff on the S. S. in a handsome bottom & groves of oak Timber, &c—</p>
                        <p><strong>August 28th</strong>: We set off early this morning with a fine breeze from the South East; and all sail set. We proceeded on and passed some prairies which lie high, they lie on the North side of the River, they appear very beautiful ascending gradually from the River, about 2 o'clock P. M. the wind blew hard from the South West the boat plunging, had a hole broke in her by running against a snag, so that we were obliged to put ashore, and had begun to unload her, but fortunately we got the hole stopped. We crossed the River to the South side and encamped, to wait the arrival of our Men, which we had sent to find out the Indian Camp the day before; in order to hold a treaty with them, We here raised a Pole in order to hoist our flag. This place lies below a large Island, and a sand bar and bluff & is below a hill, on the South side of the River.— There is also a handsome bottom near it, with Groves of fine white Oak Timber growing on it.</p>

                        <p>29th August Wednesday 1804. Rained last night and some this morning, very cloudy. Set some men to work to make a toe rope of elk skin, and myself to write. Sent one man to pursue Shannon ahead with some provisions. I am much engaged writing a speech. At 4 o'clock, Sergeant Pryor & Mr. Dorion, the Sioux interpreter, with about 70 Sioux, arrived on the opposite side of the river. We sent over for them, who came over. Mr. Dorion & his son who was trading with the Indians came over. Mr. Dorion informed that three chiefs were of the party. We sent over Sergeant Pryor with young Mr. Dorion, six kettles for the Indians to cook the meat they killed on the way from their camp (2 elk & 6 deer), about a bucket of corn & 2 twists of tobacco to smoke intending to speak to them tomorrow. G. Drewyer killed a deer. Sergeant Pryor informs that when he approached the Indian camp they came to meet them, supposing Captain Lewis or myself to be of the party intending to take us in a robe to their camp. He approached the camp which was handsomely made of buffalo skins painted different colors, their camps formed of a conic form containing about 12 or 15 persons each and 40 in number, on the River Jacque of 100 yds wide & deep containing but little wood. They had a fat dog cooked as a feast for them, and a snug apartment for them to lodge. On their march they passed through plains covered with game, &c.</p>

                        <p>29th August Wednesday 1804. Some rain last night & this morning. Sent on Colter with provisions in pursuit of Shannon, had a toe rope made of elk skin. I am much engaged writing. At 4 o'clock P M. Sergeant Pryor & Mr. Dorion with 5 chiefs and about 70 men arrived on the opposite side. We sent over a perogue & Mr. Dorion & his son who was trading with the Indians came over with Sergeant Pryor, and informed us that the chiefs were there. We sent Sergeant Pryor & young Mr. Dorion with some tobacco, corn & a few kettles for them to cook in, with directions to inform the chiefs that we would speak to them tomorrow. Those Indians brought with them for their own use 2 elk & 6 deer which the young men killed on the way from their camp 12 miles distant. Sergeant Pryor informs me that when he came near the Indian camp they were met by men with a buffalo robe to carry them. Mr. Dorion informed "they were not the owners of the boats & did not wish to be carried." The Sioux camps are handsome of a conic form covered with buffalo robes painted different colors and all compact & handsomely arranged, covered all round an open part in the center for the fire, with buffalo robes. Each lodge has a place for cooking detached, the lodges contain 10 to 15 persons. A fat dog was presented as a mark of their great respect for the party of which they partook heartily and thought it good & well flavored. The River Jacque is deep & is navigable for perogues a long distance up. At the mouth it is shallow & narrow but above it is 80 or 90 yards wide passing through rich prairies with but little timber. This river passes the Sioux River and heads with the St. Peters and a branch of Red River which falls into Lake Winnebago to the North.</p>

Colter sent on for to find the man that went on with the horses. The perogue repaired. The loading put in the white perogue; the men engaged making a towing line out of our green elk hides. We have plenty of fine fat catfish most of the time. Several large ones caught last night. The Missouri river affords us plenty of fish, & the country plenty of all kinds of game. In the afternoon Sergeant Pryor & the 2 men who went with him returned to our camp & brought with them 60 Indians of the Sioux nation. They camped on the opposite shore & did not incline to cross this evening. Our captains sent them over some lyed corn & tobacco &c. Sergeant Pryor informed me that their town is about 9 miles from the Missouri up the River Jacque. Their town consisted of about [blank] lodges which was made of painted red & white dressed buffalo & elk skins & is very handsome; the women homely the most of them old, but the young men handsome. G. Drewyer killed one deer today.</p>

The morning was cloudy with some thunder. We are generally well supplied with catfish, the best I have ever seen. Some large ones were taken last night. In the afternoon the men who had gone to the Indian camp returned and brought with them sixty Indians of the Sioux nation. They encamped for the evening upon the opposite shore, and some corn and tobacco were sent over to them. The sergeant who had gone to their camp informed me that their lodges, forty in number, are about nine miles from the Missouri on the Sacque river. They are made of dressed buffalo and elk skins, painted red and white, and are very handsome. He said the women are homely and mostly old; but the young men likely and active. They killed a dog as a token of friendship. One of our men killed a deer.</p>

                        <p>30th August Thursday 1804. A foggy morning. I am much engaged. After breakfast, we sent Mr. Dorion in a perogue to the other side for the chiefs and warriors of the Sioux. He returned at 10 o'clock with the chiefs. At 12 o'clock, I finished and we delivered a speech to the Indians expressive of the wishes of our government and explaining what would be good for themselves. After delivering the speech, we made one grand chief, 1 second chief, and three third chiefs and delivered to each a few articles and a small present to the whole. The grand chief received a parole [commission], some wampum & a flag in addition to his present. They withdrew and we retired to dinner. Mr. Durion's son was much displeased that he could not dine with Captain Lewis and myself. The number of Sioux present is about 70 men, dressed in buffalo robes, a few muskets, bows and arrows, and very much decorated with porcupine quills. A society of which only four remains is present, having made a vow never to give back. The air gun astonished them very much. After night, a circle was formed around 3 fires and those Indians danced until late, the chiefs looked on with great dignity, much pleased with what they had. We retired late and went to bed. Wind hard from the south.</p>

                        <p>30th of August Thursday 1804. A very thick fog this morning. After preparing some presents for the chiefs which we intended to give by giving medals, and finishing a speech what we intended to give them, we sent Mr. Dorion in a perogue for the chiefs & warriors to a council under an oak tree near where we had a flag flying on a high flag staff. At 12 o'clock we met and Captain Lewis delivered the speech & then made one great chief by giving him a medal & some clothes, one 2nd chief & three third chiefs in the same way. They received those things with the goods and tobacco with pleasure. To the grand chief we gave a flag and the parole [certificate] & wampum with a hat & chiefs coat. We smoked out of the pipe of peace, & the chiefs retired to a bower made of bushes by their young men to divide their presents and smoke, eat, and council. Captain Lewis & myself retired to dinner and consult about other measures. Mr. Dorion Jr. much displeased that we did not invite him to dine with us (which he was sorry for afterwards). The Sioux is a stout bold looking people, the young men handsome & well made, the greater part of them make use of bows & arrows. Some few muskets I observe among them, notwithstanding they live by the bow & arrow, they do not shoot so well as the northern Indians. The warriors are very much decorated with paint, porcupine quills & feathers, large leggings & moccasins, all with buffalo robes of different colors. The squaws wore petticoats & and a white buffalo robes with the black hair turned back over their necks & shoulders. I will here remark a society which I had never before this day heard was in any nation of Indians. Four of which is at this time present and all who remain of this band. Those who become members of this society must be brave active young men who take a vow never to give back let the danger be what it may; in war parties they always go forward without screening themselves behind trees or anything else. To this vow they strictly adhere during their lives. An instance which happened not long since, on a party in crossing the Missouri on the ice, a hole was in the ice immediately in their course which might easily have been avoided by going around, the foremost man went on and was lost. The others were dragged around by the party. In a battle with the Kite Indians who inhabit the Coul Noir or black mountain, out of 22 of this society 18 was killed, the remaining four was dragged off by their party. Those men are likely fellows, they sit together, camp & dance together. This society is in imitation of the societies of the Kite Indians from whom they imitate.</p>

                        <p>Thursday 30th. A foggy morning, a heavy dew last night. Shannon nor Colter did not come to us last night. The fog remained on the river late this morning & so thick that we could not see the Indians camp on the opposite shore. At about 8 o'clock the fog went away. Some of the Indians swam across the river to get some breakfast with us. At the hour of 9 o'clock, the commanding officers had all things in readiness to hold a council with the chiefs and warriors of the Sioux nation. They sent a perogue across for them, they all came into our camp in the most friendly manner. There were four of them who were always singing & playing on their curious instruments which were as follows: they had each of them a thrapple made of a fresh buffalo hide dressed white with some small shot in it and a little bunch of hair tied on it, the head man of them was painted white, the rest of them were painted different colors. When they arrived at our camp & took the commanding officers by

                        <p>31st of August Friday rose early, a fair Day. A curious Society among this nation worthy of remark, formed of their active determined young men, with a vow never to give back, let the danger or difficulty be what it may. In war parties, they always go forward, without Screening themselves behind trees or anything else. To this vow they Strictly adhere during their Lives. An instance of it is last winter on a march in Crossing the Missouri a hole was in the ice immediately in their Course which might easily be avoided by going around. The foremost man went on and was drowned, the others were caught by their party and dragged around. In a battle with the Crow de Curbo Indians, out of 22 of this Society 18 were killed, the remaining four were dragged off by their friends, and are now here. They associate together, Camp together, and are merry fellows. This Custom the Sioux learned of the de Carbours inhabiting the Cout Noie or Black mountain. All the Chiefs Delivered a Speech agreeing to what we Said &. &. & begged which I answered from my notes. We made or gave a certificate to two Brave men, the attendants of the Great Chief, gave them Some tobacco and prepared a Commission for Mr. Darion to make a peace with all the nations in the neighborhood, Mahas, Ponca, Panie, Loups, Ottoes, and Missouries, & to take to the President Some of the Great Chiefs of each nation who would accompany him. Also to do certain other things, and wrote Instructions, gave him a flag and Some Clothes. The Chiefs Sent all their young men home, and they Stayed for Mr. Dorion. In the evening late we gave the Commission & Instruction to Mr. Durion & he received them with pleasure, & promised to do all which was necessary. I took a Vocabulary of the Sioux language, and a few answers to Some queries I put to Mr. Pitte Dorion respecting the War No. Situation Trad &c. &. of that people which is divided into 20 tribes possessing Separate interest. They are numerous between 2 & 3000 men, divided into 20 tribes who view their interests as different. Some bands at War with Nations which other bands are at peace. This nation call themselves Dar co tar. The French call them Sioux. Their language is not peculiar to themselves as has been Stated, a great many words are the Same with the Mahas, Ponckais, Osarge, Kanzies &c. Clearly proves to me those people had the Same Origin. This nation inhabits the Red river of Hudson bay, St. Peters (Minnesota River), Mississippi, Demoin R. Jacque & on the Missouri they are at War with 20 nations, and at peace with 8 only. They receive their trade from the British except a few on the Missouri they furnish Beaver Marten, Loups, Otter, Pekon, Bear, and Deer and have forty Traders at least among them. The names of the Different bands of this nation are—</p>

                        <p>I examined my arms and accoutrements this morning and found them in good order. My eye has been sore for several days past which I conjecture is owing to the quantity of flies which have infested us since we have been in this neighbourhood. The principal fly is about the size of the honey bee and is very troublesome. The eye waters with the pain and inflammation of which I have lately applied a little spirits of wine which has given me relief. Capt. Clark's eyes also continue sore and he complains of the same cause. It is with pleasure that I observe that the animals with us seem to decrease in the proportion as we advance up the river; this I presume proceeds from the additional scarcity of food which they meet with in these barren deserts. The country in the neighbourhood of the river is broken barren and void of timber; there is little appearance of even the herbacious plants which usually decorate the plains of this country, but the prickly pear is still to be seen in vast quantities. There are a few small willow bushes to be seen at this place in the low grounds on the river bank and occasionally on the sand bars which appear to have been brought down by the river. The wind was moderate from the S. E. and the day cool; the night was also cool and being clear and serene was very comfortable. At 6 P. M. we anchored on the S. S. at the distance of three miles from the Island Mandan above a small willow bottom; a high and cold wind from the N. W. prevailed all night; the mosquetoes are yet extreemly troublesome, they seem to encrease in numbers as we ascend the river. At this place the river is about three quarters of a mile in width; the water is more transparent than it has been for some days past. I observed the air to-day at meridian the thermometer stood at 76° above 0. the river has fallen considerably since we first entered it below the Council bluffs.—

We set out early in the morning, along the north side of the island: there is handsome prairie land on the south. Three of our men went on the island to hunt. When we landed for breakfast, we heard several guns fired on the island, and saw six elk swimming across the river about a mile above where we had halted. Two of our men went up and killed one of them; those on the island killed three. About twelve, the wind blew so hard down the river, that we could not proceed, and we landed on the north side, where there is an extensive prairie. It was cloudy and rained till 4 when it cleared up. We remained here for the night and dried our meat. On the bank opposite our camp is an ancient fortification or breastwork, similar to those which have been occasionally discovered on the western waters. The two ends run at right angles to the river, and the outside, which is 2500 yards in length, parallel to it: there is no breastwork thrown up next to the river, the bank as is supposed, serving as a sufficient defence on that side.</p>

Here the river turns at right angles to the left, till it reaches the hills on the south side, then winds gradually to the right. There is no timber in this part of the country; but continued prairie on both sides of the river. A person by going on one of the hills may have a view as far as the eye can reach without any obstruction, or intervening object; and enjoy the most delightful prospects. During this day's voyage we found the hills on the opposite sides of the river generally not more than two miles apart, and the river meandering through them in various directions. We encamped on the south side.</p>

W. we proceeded on. took breakfast at one of Colters Camps where he had a scaffold of jerk &c. passed a Bottom prairie Back of which is a round naked high round knob the Captains went out to look at it.— they returned in a Short time & informed us that it was a curious place as if it had been made with hands of man. Shields killed a prairie dog, which was cooked for the Capts dinner.— the Captains went out with Some men of the party to See the Ground where those little dogs make their villages & they found more than an acre of Ground covered with their holes, they attempted to drown Several of them out of their holes, but they caught but one which they brought in alive, they are a curious animal about the Size of a little dog, & of a grayish color resembles them nearly except the tail which is like a Ground Squirrel.

                        <p>Friday 7th. We set sail early, and had a clear day: passed high prairie land on both sides; but there is some cottonwood on the low points in the bottoms. On the south side we found a scaffold of meat neatly dried. This had been left by one of our men, who had gone out on the 26th of the last month to hunt the horses, and supposing we had got a distance ahead, proceeded up the river several days' journey, before he discovered his error. Captain Lewis and Captain Clarke with some of the men went to view a round knob of a hill in a prairie, and on their return killed a prairie dog, in size about that of the smallest species domestic dogs.</p>
                        
                        <p>Having understood that the village of those small dogs was at a short distance from our camp, Captain Lewis and Captain Clarke with all the party, except the guard, went to it; and took with them all the kettles and other vessels for holding water; in order to drive the animals out of their holes by pouring in water; but though they worked at the business till night they only caught one of them.</p>
